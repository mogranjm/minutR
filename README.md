# minutetakeR [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mogranjm/minutetakeR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mogranjm/minutetakeR)
Rmarkdown template for meeting minutes

Contains two templates
- Meeting Agenda
The Agenda template contains a YAML header with parameters defining metadata about the meeting to be held (Title/DateTime/Chair/Attendees). These metadata are processed by the header and knitted into the header of the document.

The body of the template contains two markdown tables. One to summarise matters arising from previous meeting minutes and the other to define new topics to be addressed.

- Meeting Minutes
The Minutes template also has a YAML header that defines similar content to the Agenda template.

The template body contains example content for recording meeting-related particulars (Action items, decisions/outcomes, etc.)
